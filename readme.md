# Email slicer
Email Slicer is just a simple tool that will take an email address as an input and slice it to produce the username and the domain associated with it. The email must be divided into two strings by using ‘@’ as the separator.

- For example:
  - Input: mramitdas99@gmail.com
  - Output: Your username is mramitdas99 & domain is gmail.com
